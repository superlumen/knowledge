Images

Last update Dec 2019

## [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/pricing)

* One of the easiest ways to handle images in modern web apps.
* Has a free tier, gets quite expensive after that.
* Good fit for either very small projects, or ambitious startups.
* Not the best fit for amateur / hobby / longer term low cost projects.

## [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/plans)

* Meant for image optimisation, generous free tier with limits.
* $50/mth after the free tier.

The free tier offers 20GB of bandwidth per month and unlimited storage on the condition that your monthly bandwidth usage exceeds your monthly storage usage. That might not be true in the case of low use hobby applications.

## [cloudimage](https://www.cloudimage.io/en/pricing)

* Free tier with 25GB of bandwidth
* Based on optimisation of images stored elsewhere

## [UploadCare](https://uploadcare.com/pricing/)

* Free up to 100 images / month, 1GB bandwidth
* Paid from $50/month
* Includes uploaders and other stuff

## [imgpush](https://github.com/hauxir/imgpush/)

* Open source, self hosted, cloudinary alternative
* Requires servers, admin, etc, but might be suitable for some projects
