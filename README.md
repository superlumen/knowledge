# superlumen knowledge

The [wiki](https://github.com/superlumen/knowledge/wiki) is probably where you'll most of the content, although as this is a new repo, it's more or less empty right now!

## Research

Web development is a fast moving space. We routinely spend time researching various topics, and the thought behind this repo is that if we do that in an open setting, it might be useful to other folks, and we might learn something useful if we get feedback...

## Standards

Very much a work in progress....
