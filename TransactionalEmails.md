Crucial features

## [postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/)

* Doesn't have support for push notifications (yet?)

## [campaign monitor](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/)

* Starts at $9/mth for 500 recipients

## [LeaderSend](http://www.leadersend.com/)

* Looks like a somewhat cheap clone of the top dogs, but maybe marginally better than ElasticEmail

## [ElasticEmail](https://elasticemail.com/)

* Free up to 25k emails / month
* Looks a bit basic, like a cheap clone of the big names

## [SocketLabs](http://www.socketlabs.com/)

* Free up to 2k emails & 2k api calls / month
* $15 for 5k + 5k / month
* Has what looks like a basic template editor, launched Feb 2016, bit late to the game

## [SendInBlue](https://www.sendinblue.com/)

* â‚¬29/month to remove their branding

## Notes

The following services don't support transactional templates, which means the email content has to be built in the application, non starter.
* [MailGun](http://www.mailgun.com/)
* [MailJet](https://www.mailjet.com/)
* [Pepipost](http://www.pepipost.com/)

This provides a pretty detailed comparison http://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/transactional-emailing-providers-mailjet-sendgrid-critsend
